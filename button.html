                <p>Schools serve as foundational institutions in society, providing structured education to children and young adults.
                     They play a critical role in shaping the intellectual, social, and emotional development of students. By fostering
                      a learning environment, schools aim to impart knowledge across various subjects such as mathematics, science, 
                      literature, and the arts, while also promoting critical thinking.</p>
